Welcome to the inspirAItion project! This project is designed for the 6th team of the 3rd team project of MS AI School 5th.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run Django locally, you'll need the following:

1. **Python** (version 3.8 or higher) installed on your machine.
2. **PostgreSQL** installed and configured on your local environment.
3. Install dependencies via `pip` using the `requirements.txt` file.
   - Example: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. You may have **Node.js** and **npm** installed to handle front-end dependencies if needed.
5. You may also need to have **Virtualenv** installed to manage the virtual environment for the project.

### Installing

Step-by-step instructions to get the development environment up and running:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd yourrepository
   ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Mac/Linux
   .\venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
   ```
4. Install the required Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Set up your PostgreSQL database and configure it in your Django settings.
6. Run Django **migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations

   ```
8. Run the Django **server**:
   ```bash
